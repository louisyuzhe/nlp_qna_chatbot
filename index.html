    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p id="passage">Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in
Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising
technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is
considered one of the Big Four technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple,
and Facebook. Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin
while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. Together
they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the
stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as
a California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California. Google
was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002. An initial public
offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its
headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August
2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a
conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and
will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests.
Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the
CEO of Alphabet.</p>
